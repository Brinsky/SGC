The Steam Game Comparator (SGC)

Description:
The SGC finds the overlap between the game collections of multiple Steam users. It also creates a nice chart to display this overlap.


Requirements:
The SGC is implemented in Python 3 and requires the external beautifulsoup4 and httplib2 packages (both of which are available through pip!).


Notes:
As my first serious python program, the SGC is fairly messy. Although it serves its purpose, it could benefit from many additional features:

*Features that would be nice*
-Sorting of the games before outputting
-Outputting to a text file
-Handling httplib2 exceptions cleanly
-Somehow allow login to the Steam Community (in order to access certain private profiles of friends)
-Allow for only mutliplayer games to be listed (possibly by using the appids to find and parse each game's store page)
-Output a different chart when only two players are compared (all games in common show Xs, so there is little added benefit to the current chart)
-General code cleanup and optimization

Maybe I will add some of these features, but I will probably not implement all of them. Even cooler would be if YOU implemented them (or other features that you desire). I would love to hear about it if you do.


Example:
The following is an example of what a typical SGC console session might look like.
